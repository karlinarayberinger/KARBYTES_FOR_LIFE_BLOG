<p><strong>SOLIPSIM:</strong> the inevitable condition of any frame of reference being aware only of what it contains.</p>
<p>More specifically, any frame of reference, R, is only aware of the qualia which R contains in what R experiences as the present moment. Formally, any point, t, in the timeline in which R exists as a linear and chronological continuum of all the qualia which R ever renders could be represented as R(t) while R is the summation of all instances of R(t) where t is a discrete unit of time elapsed according to R.</p>
<p><strong>SELFISHNESS:</strong> the inevitable tendency for any information processing agent to only be concerned with what transpires inside of its own inevitably solipsist field of awareness (especially in a utilitarian context centered around that agent&#8217;s conceptual worldview, decision-making thought processes and behavioral outcomes, and sensory or computational feedback about whether such ongoing decision implementations are fulfilling the agent&#8217;s goals or not).</p>
<p>Note that any information processing agent, X, is incapable of implementing altruistic behavior (i.e. assisting an agent other than X (i.e. Y) in attaining Y&#8217;s own goals) in a manner that is not primarily conceived of and implemented by X in order to enable X to attain X&#8217;s own goals.</p>
<p><strong>HEDONISM:</strong> the general tendency of a sentient information processing agent to avoid experiencing pain and, also, to attempt to experience pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>DETERMINISM:</strong> the tendency for the qualia which an information processing agent observes (and to remember observing) to be rendered in a manner which that agent can predict (to some non-trivial degree of accuracy) due to the fact that such qualia appear to that agent to be unique instances of recurrent patterns which follow consistent logical associations.</p>
<p>Laws of physics are assumptions about how discrete and non-identical allocations of matter and energy interact with each other and evolve as time elapses according to the observing frames of reference.</p>
<p>Mathematics are immutable logical rules about how numbers relate to each other and themselves. For instance, &#8220;1 = 1&#8221; is always true and is logically equivalent to &#8220;1 = 2 &#8211; 1&#8221;.</p>
