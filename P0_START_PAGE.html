egotist : egoist :: energy_waste :: survival.

// karbytes fancies itself to be an egoist rather than an egotist (at the "core" of what karbytes actually is and not merely at some "facade layer" encompassing and being projected from that "core" (which karbytes visualized to be some hole inside of some phenomenal mesh which travels through that mesh much the way an electrical current (measured as some quantity of voltage) travels along a linear path comprised of adjacent electron clouds (such that the "voltage" is a traveling gap between adjacent electron clouds)).

// facade : electron :: core : <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voltage</a>.

// Do not get too "carried away" with this potentially absurdist musings about physical reality. It may or may not be an accurate depiction of electricity and of metaphysical phenomena (if any exist).

According to karbytes, an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egoist</a> is a person who believes that all of one's own actions should be performed entirely in service to one's own goals (but not necessarily by preventing other persons from performing actions which are in service to those persons' own goals).

According to karbytes, an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egotism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egotist</a> is an egoist who insists on preventing persons other than itself from making progress towards their own goals because doing so is deemed to be necessary or simply more advantageous for that egotist than if that egotist did not deliberately attempt to impede the goal-oriented activities of what are deemed by that egotist to be that egotist's competitors who, according to that egotist, cause that egotist to suffer a loss of value as a result of that egotists' competitors appearing to that egotist to be gaining value. 

<span style="background:#ffff00">karbytes claims that karbytes would most likely not voluntarily sacrifice its own survival nor sacrifice its own success in order to enable persons other than karbytes to have an easier time surviving or attaining success at their goals. Therefore, karbytes considers itself to be an egotist in ideal situations but not necessarily in situations in which finite resources which karbytes and other persons covet is sufficiently scarce. (By implication, karbytes may resort to intentionally physically attacking if not killing persons which karbytes thinks are serious impediments to karbytes' highest-priority goals).</span>

<span style="background:#ffff00">What karbytes meant to imply by the first analogy on this web page (i.e. the analogy closest to the top of the web page) is that an information processing agent generally spends more energy being what karbytes refers to as an egotist than what that information processing agent spends on being merely what karbytes refers to as an egotist. That is because egotists tend to initiate wars while egoists tend to avoid getting involved in wars. Wars are some of the most expensive (especially relative to the benefits) enterprises information processing agents could involve themselves in.</span>
