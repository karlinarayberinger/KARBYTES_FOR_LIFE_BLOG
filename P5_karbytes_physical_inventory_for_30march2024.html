<p>The entire aforementioned collection of M_DISCs (encoding digital files) and binders (containing paper-and-ink print-outs of PDFs) fit compactly inside of the three storage containers depicted by the images which are displayed and referenced on this web page. At 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 31_MARCH_2024 (and according to karbytes&#8217; knowledge) those three aforementioned storage containers are located inside of a single locked <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Storage</a> unit which karbytes has keys to lock and unlock and which karbytes does not approve of any person other than the Public Storage facility property managers and law enforcement personnel entering.</p>
<p>If karytes dies, becomes severely incapacitated, incarcerated, or otherwise vanishes from society, karbytes implores those with legal access to karbytes&#8217; Public Storage unit to donate the entire aforementioned collection of M_DISCs and binders to a facility which specializes in preserving cultural and software-related artifacts. (karbytes understands that there is no guarantee that the request which karbytes made in the previous sentence will be fulfilled. Therefore, even if karbytes&#8217; aforementioned physical property is not preserved for an infinitely long period of time, <u>karbytes derives comfort and enjoyment from keeping such physical property instantiated for as long as possible and especially while karbytes is alive because such physical property (and the digital files those physical <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">substrates</a> verbatim preserve) functions as an augmentation and preserver of some of karbytes&#8217; most cherished memories for karbytes&#8217; indefinitely many future selves to access indefinitely many times and across an indefinitely long time period</u>).</p>

<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Within the context of this web page, IMAGE_0 is a reference to the karbytes-created photographic image named karbytes_physical_inventory_essential_31mar2024.jpg. IMAGE_0 depicts two fireproof ziplocking compact disc cases which contain the entirety of the body of intellectual property referred to as karbytes by the web page named ABOUT_KARBYTES on this web page&#8217;s encompassing website (i.e. Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) as that body of intellectual property is configured as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_MARCH_2024. Details about each of the zip files and encompassing folders which comprise that entire body of intellectual property are available at the web page named mdisc_karbytes_30_march_2024 of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com. The blue (i.e. leftmost) compact disc case depicted in IMAGE_0 contains two M_DISCs which each contain exactly one folder containing exactly 32 zip files (and that folder is named karbytes_30march2024_core). That blue compact disc case also contains one M_DISC which contains exactly one folder containing exactly 69 zip files (and that folder is named karbytes_20march2024_journals). The green (i.e. rightmost) compact disc case depicted in IMAGE_0 contains more than three (and no more than eight) M_DISCs and exactly three of those M_DISCs each contain exactly one folder containing exactly 69 zip files (and that folder is named karbytes_20march2024_journals).

<p><span style="background:#c8b2d9;font-family: monospace">In the image, an organized workspace features a dark gray bin lid, holding one blue and one green zipped case, each marked with cardboard labels indicating M_DISC copies of &#8216;karbytes&#8217; journals. Above, on the bin, there are two large green binders and a turquoise folder, topped by a white binder labeled &#8220;Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com.&#8221; To the left, on a white surface, there is a single small pink case and two white rectangular packages.

<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Within the context of this web page, IMAGE_1 is a reference to the karbytes-created photographic image named karbytes_physical_inventory_overview_31mar2024.jpg. IMAGE_1 depicts a white microwave oven which is used as the designated storage container for the three items which are on top of it (and those three items are two white Amazon envelopes and one cheap pink plastic compact disc case which each contain all the M_DISCs which karbytes made containing exclusively karbytes content which were made before the karbytes content encompassed by karbytes_30march2024_core and karbytes_20march2024_journals were made. In other words, what karbytes stores in that microwave oven are exclusively &#8220;legacy versions&#8221; of files which constitute the karbytes-created websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com before each of those websites was updated in March 2024). Image_1 also depicts two gray plastic storage containers which are used to store M_DISCs containing the files which constitute the aforementioned websites as those websites were configured on or after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_MARCH_2024 (but there are also a few M_DISCs in the green compact disc case which contain less up-to-date karbytes backups). The white binder whose cover displays solely the words &#8220;Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com&#8221; (excluding the quotation marks) is stored inside of a metal safe which is barely big enough to contain that binder and exactly one of those two &#8220;essential karbytes&#8221; compact disc containers. The blue compact disc container (which contains one M_DISC copy of the folder (containing exclusively 32 unique zip files) named karbytes_30march2024_core and two M_DISC copies of the folder (containing exclusively 69 unique zip files) named karbytes_20march2024_journals) is stored inside of that metal safe on top of the white binder (and that safe is stored on top of the stack of binders depicted in IMAGE_1 such that the stack of binders is wrapped inside of a large gray and brown tarp (and the binders and metal safe are stored inside exactly one of the two gray storage bins depicted in IMAGE_1)). Each of the binders (i.e. two large green binders beneath one turquoise folder beneath one white binder) depicted in IMAGE_1 contains exclusively each paper-and-ink printout which karbytes made of each PDF file which exists inside of the set of aforementioned folders named karbytes_30march2024_core and karbytes_20march2024_journals.</span></p>
