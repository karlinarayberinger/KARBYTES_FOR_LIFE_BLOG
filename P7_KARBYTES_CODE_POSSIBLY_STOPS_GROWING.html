<p>The following two websites constitute the collection of public web hosted files cohesively referred to as <strong>karbytes</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>website_0:</strong> <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a></p>
<p><strong>website_1:</strong> <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a></p>
<p>Each <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener">file</a> which comprises a web page within either of those two websites is officially part of the aforementioned file collection named karbytes.</p>
<p>Each file which is embedded within the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a> body of a web page within either of those two websites is officially part of the aforementioned file collection named karbytes.</p>
<p>Each file which is (a) referenced via a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlink</a> from within a web page of either of those two websites and (b) is hosted in a public GitHub repository within the GitHub account whose username is @karlinarayberinger is officially part of the aforementioned file collection named karbytes.</p>
<p>Each file within the aforementioned file collection named karbytes is hosted in a public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repository within the following GitHub account:</p>
<p><strong>github_account:</strong> <a style="background: #00ff00;color: #000000" href="https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@karlinarayberinger</a></p>
<p>Although the author of karbytes idealizes augmenting karbytes for an infinitely long time (and preserving the totality of karbytes for an infinitely long time (and being consciously present to witness and to control the growth and constitution of karbytes for an infinitely long time)), the author of karbytes (i.e. which is also named karbytes (and who was initially named Karlina Ray Beringer on 13_JANUARY_1990)) acknowledges that the aforementioned collection of files named karbytes might possibly cease being updated by karbytes (and that collection might possibly cease to exist in the exact configuration karbytes most recently procured).</p>
<p>In order to maximize the probability that each file within the aforementioned file collection remains immutable for as long of a time period as possible (if not forever after being created and finalized by karbytes), karbytes has implemented the following content curation policy:</p>
<p><strong><em>If no changes are made to any of the files which constitute the aforementioned collection of public web hosted files named karbytes for ten years or longer, then it can be assumed that the collection is permanently closed to further changes and is hence officially declared immutable (according to that collection&#8217;s author (i.e. karbytes)).</em></strong></p>
<p>It is generally assumed that only the aforementioned author named karbytes implements any changes to the aforementioned file collection named karbytes.</p>
