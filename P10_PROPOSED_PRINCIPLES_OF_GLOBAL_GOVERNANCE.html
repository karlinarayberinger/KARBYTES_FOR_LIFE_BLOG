<p><strong>PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">The following list outlines components of what is considered to be an ideal human civilization (and which is thought to be implementable with the help of existing and future technology (especially artificial intelligence, a global &#8220;real time&#8221; surveillance network comprised of many sensors and routers which &#8220;instantaneously&#8221; communicate with larger and more powerful stationary supercomputers, and a World Wide Web which is freely accessible for all human individuals to use in order to access and update digital files)):</span></p>
<p><strong>0. UNIVERSAL_SUSTENANCE_VOUCHERS:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is unconditionally eligible to receive (a) seven vouchers per week which each can be used to pay for one night stay at any &#8220;economy hotel&#8221; (but not necessarily at any &#8220;luxury hotel&#8221;), (b) three vouchers per day which each can be used to pay for one meal at an &#8220;economy cafeteria&#8221; (but not necessarily at other restaurants) which serves nutritious breakfasts, lunches, and diners, (c) one voucher per day which represents three hours of computer usage (with Internet access) and twenty pages of printer usage at a library, (d) one voucher per mobile phone which the voucher recipient uses to obtain or replace a mobile phone and no more than one mobile phone per day (and the surveillance network does not allow vouchers to be used to replace a phone if the voucher user is deemed by the surveillance network to already have a working phone in service), and (e) one voucher per week which can be used to pay for one hundred miles worth of public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, or taxis). Such vouchers are reimbursed as often as stated by this paragraph and are entirely electronic (i.e. deposited into the voucher recipient&#8217;s personal sustenance vouchers web-based account and associated with that recipient&#8217;s unique social security number and the recipient&#8217;s username and password combination). In order to use those vouchers, the voucher user enters its username and password into the payment terminal inside the buildings or vehicles where such vouchers can be used to purchase what are deemed to be &#8220;basic commodities&#8221;. Finally, each voucher expires immediately after a new one of its kind is reimbursed into the respective voucher account.</p>
<p><strong>1. UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is automatically and unconditionally issued a monthly income which is not less than one thousand dollars (but not larger than some government-approved maximum dollar amount for monthly universal basic income allotment (in order to prevent an excessively uneven distribution of wealth across all human members of the encompassing society)). Such funds are mostly (if not entirely) paid for in the form of corporate taxes which are taken out of the profits earned by any government-approved businesses (whether or not such businesses employ humans or robots). Such funds can be used to purchase commodities which are not necessarily deemed to be &#8220;basic commodities&#8221; although there is a maximum limit in terms of how many of one item a particular consumer may purchase per finite time period in order to prevent one consumer from buying out the entire supply of a particular item. Finally, and unlike vouchers, any money which a human individual is issued (into its own personal bank account which also is linked to the user&#8217;s unique social security number and to a particular username and password combination) either automatically through the government-issued monthly income deposit or from any other money (e.g. &#8220;earned supplemental income&#8221;) is not removed from the bank account unless those funds are spent by the bank account user or are deemed by the government to be deposited using fraudulent means.</p>
<p><strong>2. EARNED_SUPPLEMENTAL_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is eligible to be employed as a paid worker for some government-approved employer for contract periods which offer a set amount of base pay per hour or per week (with optional and variable commission pay dependent on employee performance) for that contract period on condition that the employee performs the duties assigned by that employer to that employer&#8217;s satisfaction. Employment contracts may be extended by one finite time period contract length indefinitely many times provided that the employer and employee agree to the terms of each one of those contracts.</p>
<p><strong>3. ARTIFICIAL_WOMBS_AND_ORPHANAGES:</strong> if the population of human individuals within the respective society is deemed to be too small (according to the government) and there are sufficiently many human workers (who are eighteen years old or older) willing and able to fill all roles at government-run boarding schools and infant production and care facilities, then high-quality human genomes will be computer generated (to ensure that such genomes have no defects) and used to generate human stem cells which will then be placed inside of incubator chambers which simulate human wombs. The resulting human infants incubated and then ejected from such artificial wombs will then be housed and educated in state-run boarding schools which employ human employees.</p>
<p><strong>4. LICENSED_PROCURING_OF_CHILDREN:</strong> all human individuals within the respective society are required to pass a strict government-issued background check before being legally permitted to bare or adopt any human children (and violators of that policy would be penalized by having their children taken away from them by child protective services to be placed in orphanages or foster care and the transgressors would be imprisoned for up to five years per such offense). This is to ensure that the population does not become too large for every one of its constituent persons to enjoy a comfortable and safe standard of living. Also, each human individual who is less than eighteen years old or who is not an emancipated minor is required to attend a government-approved public school as soon as that person attains three years of age. </p>
<p><strong>5. MAXIMUM_POPULATION_SIZE:</strong> in order for every human individual who is currently alive to attain immortality (or to at least approach it), humans would need to stop making babies after the global human population size reaches a particular maximum size (so that no human is forced against its will to die or to undergo a loss of quality of life). Therefore, while the maximum population size for that population is attained, it is illegal for any existing human individual to bare additional offspring.</p>
