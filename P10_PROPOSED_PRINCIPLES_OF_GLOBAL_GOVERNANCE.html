<p><strong>PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">The following concepts are part of what is considered to be an ideal human civilization (and which is thought to be implementable with the help of existing and future technology (especially artificial intelligence and a global internet which is freely accessible to all persons)):</span></p>
<p><strong>1. UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME:</strong> each person aged 18 years or older (or who is an &#8220;emancipated minor&#8221;) is automatically and unconditionally issued a monthly income which is no less than five thousand dollars. Such funds are paid for in the form of corporate taxes which are taken from profits such corporations earn each year (especially while employeeing robots in place of humans for any tasks which are deemed suitable to be outsourced to robots).</p>
<p><strong>2. EARNED_SUPPLEMENTAL_INCOME:</strong> each person is eligible to apply for jobs which are posted on public forums by employeeing companies (which are required to pay some percentage of its profits as taxes and which must obtain a business permit from the government in order to employee human workers (and the business must pay each employee the amount per hour advertised on the public job forums for each hour that employee works for that business)).</p>
<p><strong>3. FREEDOM_OF_EXPRESSION:</strong> each person is permitted the unconditional right to (a) adopt any belief system or knowledge, (b) practice any lifestyle, and (c) use the Internet freely provided that all three of those items (i.e. prefaced with &#8220;(a)&#8221;, &#8220;(b)&#8221;, &#8220;(c)&#8221;) implemented by one person does not obstruct any other person from being able to implement those three items for itself.</p>
<p><strong>4. ARTIFICIAL_WOMBS_AND_ORPHANAGES:</strong> if the population of persons is deemed to be too small, then high-quality human genomes will be computer generated and used to generate human stem cells which are then placed in incubator chambers which simulate human wombs (and the resulting infants will be housed and educated in state-run boarding schools which employ human and robot workers (and which will not be instantiated unless there are sufficiently many human workers willing and able to work as employees at such institutions)).</p>
