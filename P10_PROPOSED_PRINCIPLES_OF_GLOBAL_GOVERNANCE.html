<p><strong>PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">The following list outlines components of what is considered to be an ideal human civilization (and which is thought to be implementable with the help of existing and future technology (especially artificial intelligence, a global &#8220;real time&#8221; surveillance network comprised of many sensors and routers which &#8220;instantaneously&#8221; communicate with larger and more powerful stationary supercomputers, and a World Wide Web which is freely accessible for all human individuals to use in order to access and update digital files)):</span></p>
<p><strong>0. UNIVERSAL_SUSTENANCE_VOUCHERS:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is unconditionally eligible to receive (a) seven vouchers per week which each can be used to pay for one night stay at any &#8220;economy hotel&#8221; (but not necessarily at any &#8220;luxury hotel&#8221;), (b) three vouchers per day which each can be used to pay for one meal at an &#8220;economy cafeteria&#8221; (but not necessarily at other restaurants) which serves nutritious breakfasts, lunches, and diners, (c) one voucher per day which represents three hours of computer usage (with Internet access) and twenty pages of printer usage at a library, (d) one voucher per mobile phone which the voucher recipient uses to obtain or replace a mobile phone and no more than one mobile phone per day (and the surveillance network does not allow vouchers to be used to replace a phone if the voucher user is deemed by the surveillance network to already have a working phone in service), and (e) one voucher per week which can be used to pay for one hundred miles worth of public transportation (i.e. buses, trains, or taxis). Such vouchers are reimbursed as often as stated by this paragraph and are entirely electronic (i.e. deposited into the voucher recipient&#8217;s personal sustenance vouchers web-based account and associated with that recipient&#8217;s unique social security number and the recipient&#8217;s username and password combination). In order to use those vouchers, the voucher user enters its username and password into the payment terminal inside the buildings or vehicles where such vouchers can be used to purchase what are deemed to be &#8220;basic commodities&#8221;. Finally, each voucher expires immediately after a new one of its kind is reimbursed into the respective voucher account.</p>
<p><strong>1. UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is automatically and unconditionally issued a monthly income which is not less than one thousand dollars (but not larger than some government-approved maximum dollar amount for monthly universal basic income allotment (in order to prevent an excessively uneven distribution of wealth across all human members of the encompassing society)). Such funds are mostly (if not entirely) paid for in the form of corporate taxes which are taken out of the profits earned by any government-approved businesses (whether or not such businesses employ humans or robots). Such funds can be used to purchase commodities which are not necessarily deemed to be &#8220;basic commodities&#8221; although there is a maximum limit in terms of how many of one item a particular consumer may purchase per finite time period in order to prevent one consumer from buying out the entire supply of a particular item. Finally, and unlike vouchers, any money which a human individual is issued (into its own personal bank account which also is linked to the user&#8217;s unique social security number and to a particular username and password combination) either automatically through the government-issued monthly income deposit or from any other money (e.g. &#8220;earned additional income&#8221;) is not removed from the bank account unless those funds are spent by the bank account user or are deemed by the government to be deposited using fraudulent means.</p>
<p><strong>2. EARNED_ADDITIONAL_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is eligible to be employed as a paid worker for some government-approved employer for contract periods which offer a set amount of base pay per hour or base pay per week (with optional and variable commission pay dependent on employee performance) for the duration of each contract period provided that the employee performs the duties assigned by that employer to that employer&#8217;s satisfaction. Employment contracts may be extended by one finite time period contract length indefinitely many times provided that the employer and employee agree to the contract terms for each one of those contract periods.</p>
<p><strong>3. ARTIFICIAL_WOMBS_AND_ORPHANAGES:</strong> if the population size of a human society becomes smaller than a particular minimum size and there are sufficiently many human workers (who are eighteen years old or older) willing and able to fill all roles at government-run boarding schools and infant production and care facilities, then a batch of unique and high-quality human genomes will be computer generated (to ensure that such genomes have no defects) and used to generate human stem cells which will then be placed inside of incubator chambers which simulate human wombs. The resulting human infants incubated and then removed from such artificial wombs will then be housed and educated in a government-run boarding school which employs human workers who are eighteen years old or older and, also, competent and willing to perform their assigned duties at that institution.</p>
<p><strong>4. LICENSED_PROCURING_OF_CHILDREN:</strong> all human individuals who are members of a society populated by many human individuals would need to obtain government approval to create or to adopt any human individuals who are less than eighteen years old or who are not emancipated minors. Human individuals who create or adopt non-adult humans without government permission to do so would be imprisoned for up to five years while those children are relocated to an orphanage. This is to ensure that the population size does not become too large for every one of its constituent persons to enjoy a comfortable and safe standard of living and, also, to prevent child neglect. Also, each human individual who is less than eighteen years old or who is not an emancipated minor is required to attend a government-approved school as soon as that human individual attains five years of age. </p>
<p>All XY-chromosomed humans are required to get a reversible vasectomy before those humans each become 14 years old. After each of those humans gets its first legally mandatory vasectomy, that human may have the vasectomy reversed after that human becomes 18 years old and fulfills specific government requirements for parental fitness and if the global and local human population sizes do not exceed the government-determined maximums. </p>
<p>All XX-chromosomed humans are encouraged but not required to utilize birth control methods which currently exist in human civilization at the time this web page was most recently updated. XX-chromosomed humans who become pregnant (whether with government approval or without government approval) are legally allowed to abort that pregnancy if that pregnancy is not older than three months without being legally penalized for doing so. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether or not any humans are using any birth control method, each of those humans are legally required to get government approval in order to contribute their own gametes to any human pregnancy which is carried to term. Human individuals who contribute their own gametes to any human pregnancy which is carried is carried to term without first obtaining government approval are to be sentenced to up to five years in prison and to lose custody of the resulting biological offspring.</p>
<p><strong>5. MAXIMUM_POPULATION_SIZE:</strong> in order for every human individual who is currently alive (and a member of a society populated by many human individuals) to attain immortality (or to at least extend its lifespan for an indefinitely long time period), the humans of that society would need to stop making babies after the global human population size reaches a particular maximum size (so that no human is forced against its will to die or to undergo a significant loss of quality of life). Therefore, while the maximum population size for that society is attained, it is illegal for any existing human individual within that society to conspire in the generation of additional human offspring (whether by sexual reproduction or by other means such as cloning).</p>
<p><strong>6. UNCONDITIONAL_SUICIDE_ACCESS:</strong> any human individual who is eighteen years old or older (or who is an emancipated minor) is unconditionally permitted the right to schedule an appointment at a suicide clinic in order to undergo physician assisted suicide using means which are assumed to be as quick and as painless as possible. On a societal level, such a &#8220;process of elimination&#8221; ensures that whoever has adult-level privileges within human society generally and sincerely wants to continue living (which means that such people are not as much of a burden on society as they otherwise would be).</p>
