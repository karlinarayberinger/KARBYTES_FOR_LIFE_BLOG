<p><strong>PROPOSED_PRINCIPLES_OF_GLOBAL_GOVERNANCE</strong></p>
<hr />
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;color:#000000">The following concepts are part of what is considered to be an ideal human civilization (and which is thought to be implementable with the help of existing and future technology (especially artificial intelligence and a global internet which is freely accessible to all persons)):</span></p>
<p><strong>1. UNIVERSAL_BASIC_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older is automatically and unconditionally issued a monthly income which is not less than five thousand dollars (but not larger than some government-approved maximum dollar amount for monthly universal basic income allotment (in order to prevent an excessively uneven distribution of wealth across all human members of the encompassing society)). Such funds are mostly (if not entirely) paid for in the form of corporate taxes which are taken out of the profits earned by any government-approved businesses (whether or not such businesses employ humans or robots). </p>
<p><strong>2. EARNED_SUPPLEMENTAL_INCOME:</strong> each human individual who is eighteen years old or older is eligible to be employed as a paid worker for some government-approved business which posts job openings for prospective job applicants to find on public Internet-based job forums (and such forums must keep information about each business posting job openings on that forum publicly available (whether or not that business has available job openings) in the form of number of human employees who are currently working for that company (and each of those people&#8217;s their respective job titles and roles within that business), the hourly pay rate per employee role, and business location and business contact information). Each business which hires human employees is legally required to pay each employee according to the publicly-listed hourly pay rate for each hour that employee works for that business (and the highest earning workers within that business are not legally allowed to be paid more than ten times the pay rate of that business&#8217;s lowest-earning employees (and any surplus money that business earns which is left over after each employee in that business is paid per hour of work (per monthly pay cycle (which is the standard pay cycle across all businesses in the respective society) is converted to taxes)). Each company which hires human employees has the legal right to terminate the employment of any of its employees for any reason.</p>
<p><strong>3. FREEDOM_OF_EXPRESSION:</strong> each human individual within the respective society is permitted the unconditional right to (a) adopt or study any belief system or knowledge, (b) practice any lifestyle, and (c) use the Internet in any manner which does not violate government policies provided that all three of those items (i.e. prefaced with &#8220;(a)&#8221;, &#8220;(b)&#8221;, &#8220;(c)&#8221;) implemented by one person does not obstruct any other person from being able to implement those three items for itself. In general, it is illegal for one human individual to inflict physical violence against some human individual other than itself unless such violence is deployed as a means of self-defense in a situation in which the deployer of &#8220;self-defense&#8221; believes that the deployer of self-defense was in immediate physical danger due to being in close proximity to whoever the target of that &#8220;self-defense&#8221; is and as a result of that target threatening to physically injure or kill the deployer of self-defense. Also, it is generally illegal for a human individual to intentionally destroy or steal property or money which belongs to some other human individual.</p>
<p><strong>4. ARTIFICIAL_WOMBS_AND_ORPHANAGES:</strong> if the population of human individuals within the respective society is deemed to be too small (according to the government), then high-quality human genomes will be computer generated (to ensure that such genomes have no defects) and used to generate human stem cells which will then be placed inside of incubator chambers which simulate human wombs. The resulting human infants incubated and then ejected from such artificial wombs will then be housed and educated in state-run boarding schools which employ human and/or robot workers. As long as there are insufficiently many human workers willing and able to work as employees at such institutions, no human infants are permitted to be born and all human pregnancies will either be aborted or else the resulting infants of those pregnancies will be euthanized.</p>
<p><strong>5. LICENSED_PROCURING_OF_CHILDREN:</strong> all human individuals within the respective society are required to pass a strict and rigorous government-issued background check before being legally permitted to bare or adopt human children (and violators of that policy would be penalized by having their children taken away from them by child protective services to be placed in orphanages or foster care and the transgressors would be imprisoned for up to five years per such offense). This is to ensure that the population does not become too large to for every one of its constituent persons has access to sufficient physical and societal resources which enable that person to enjoy a comfortable and safe standard of living. Also, each child is required to attend and live at a state-run boarding school once that child reaches five years of age. This is to ensure that the children have ample opportunity to be educated, to socialize with peers and professional adults, and to prepare to be autonomous adults (and so that the biological or adoptive parents of such children do not have much of an opportunity to abuse those children and hence thwart those children&#8217;s development). Such boarding schools are paid for almost entirely (if not entirely) by corporate taxes.</p>
<p><strong>6. MAXIMUM_POPULATION_SIZE:</strong> in order for every human individual who is currently alive to attain immortality (or to at least approach it), humans would need to stop making babies after the global human population size reaches a particular maximum size (so that no human is forced against its will to die or to undergo a loss of quality of life). In order for a human individual to attain immortality (or, at the very least, approach immortality as closely as possible), a process of incrementally replacing damaged human body parts with lab-generated stem cells using stem cells which contain that human individual&#8217;s genome will be implemented to the fullest extent possible (and such a process would be implemented before the universe in which that human individual lives becomes too inhospitable for human civilization to take place inside of due to that universe undergoing entropy-related &#8220;heat death&#8221;). It is hoped that human individuals can find a way to continue surviving for an indefinitely long time (if not for an infinitely long time) by creating and then traveling through a wormhole into a lower-entropy universe indefinitely many times.</p>
<p><strong>7. DECENTRALIZED_REAL_TIME_GOVERNANCE:</strong> government policies are enforced by a global surveillance network which utilizes sensing and data-routing drones and artificial general intelligence to monitor and make adjustments to existing policies as that system deems fit (and a small committee of the society&#8217;s most educated experts (who are eighteen years old or older) will oversee such activities and intervene if such people decide that the governing technologies are being misused or malfunctioning in ways which are counter to the principles outlined in this document). Also, any human individuals who are eighteen years old or older can post ideas for amending existing rules of societal governance on public Internet based forums (and, each month, the twenty highest-ranking of such proposals will be presented to the governing body of artificial intelligence and the oligarchal human committee overseeing that artificial intelligence as something for that committee to publicly veto or else immediately implement as an amendment to existing governing rules. (The committee alone decides which humans to appoint as committee members)).</p>
