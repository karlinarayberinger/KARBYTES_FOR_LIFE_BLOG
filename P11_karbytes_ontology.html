<p><span style="background:#ffff00">This web page outlines <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes&#8217;</a> conceptualization about how reality works. Such concepts are <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ontological</a> rather than prescriptive (i.e. <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ethical</a>) in nature. What that means is that this web page does not prescribe actionable rules by which an <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> conducts its own behavior. Instead, this web page presents beliefs karbytes has (at 3:00PM Pacific Standard Time on 18_JANUARY_2025) about how reality works at a fundamental level and could be interpreted as an extension of the tome which is the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARLINA OBJECT dot WordPress dot Com</a>.</span></p>

<p>Key Facts About KARBYTES&#8217; (Current Worldview)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>1. NIHILISM:</u></strong> karbytes believes that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purpose" target="_blank" rel="noopener">purpose</a> and ethics are merely thought processes generated by and subjectively experienced by <strong>&#8220;Sufficiently Sentient Information Processing Agents&#8221;</strong> rather than unconditionally ubiquitous properties of nature (and karbytes thinks that such mental phenomena are subject to change over time and cannot exist independently of the computational hardware which render and experience those thoughts).</p>
<p>The fact that karbytes is a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihilism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nihilist</a> means that karbytes has a situational rather than generalized notion of personal ethics. For example, karbytes may justify the eating of non-vegan products if karbytes thinks that no other viable nutrition options are available (including perhaps cannibalism) while generally adhering to a vegan diet due to the fact that karbytes generally stays confined to environments where vegan options are relatively plentiful.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>2. SOLIPSISM:</u></strong> karbytes believes that karbytes only knows what occurs inside of karbytes&#8217; own personal subjective frame of reference and (currently) has no viable means to become cognizant of any phenomena which occur outside of that scope. </p>
<p>The fact that karbytes is a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solipsist</a> does not necessarily mean that karbytes thinks that all that exists in the present moment is whatever karbytes is subjectively aware of in that moment. Instead, karbytes acknowledges that phenomena other than what karbytes is aware of at any time could take place outside of karbytes&#8217; awareness (but proving that such is the case seems to be a futile endeavor according to karbytes&#8217; current understanding of reality).</p>
<p>karbytes refers to itself as a &#8220;relative solipsist&#8221; instead of an &#8220;absolute solipsist&#8221;. </p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">If karbytes is an &#8220;absolute solipsist&#8221;, then karbytes believes that the only phenomena which ever occur throughout all of nature are what occur as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">qualia</a> inside of karbytes&#8217; own subjective frame of reference and that literally anything else is purely nothingness. Even more precisely, it could be said that, if karbytes is an &#8220;absolute solipsist&#8221;, then karbytes believes that only the qualia which are <strong>currently</strong> being observed by karbytes exist and that everything else is literally identical to pure nothingness.</span></p>
<p>(An &#8220;absolute solipsist&#8221; implicitly believes that it imagines itself into existence rather than discovers itself to be existing after not initially being aware that it exists).</p>
<p>If karbytes is a &#8220;relative solipsist&#8221;, then karbytes believes that there could be phenomena other than what karbytes experiences (whether in the past, present, or future) as qualia inside of karbytes&#8217; own subjective frame of reference (and such phenomena (which karbytes does not ever observe), according to karbytes&#8217; frame of reference, are referred to as noumena (by the definitions presented on the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/</a> )).</p>
<hr>
<p><strong><u>3. COMPATIBILISM:</u></strong> karbytes believes that free will (i.e. agency) is an emergent property of relatively low-level (i.e. concrete) and deterministic processes rather than merely an illusion.</p>
<p>karbytes refers to itself more as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatibilism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;compatibilist&#8221;</a> than as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#8220;hard determinist&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>If karbytes is a &#8220;hard determinist&#8221;, then karbytes believes that free will does not exist and that all processes occur in a manner which could be said to be pre-determined (which means that, if it were possible for an information processing agent to know the state of the entire universe at any point in time in the relative past (as an informationally complete snapshot of that universe at that exact point in time), then that information processing agent could infer from that snapshot what that entire universe would look like at any other point in time after that initial snapshot was take). That means that all future events are inextricably controlled by past events (within the same respective universe (which is a unified yet complex and evolving information structure)).</p>
<p>If karbytes is a &#8220;compatibilist&#8221;, then karbytes believes that free will exists as a spontaneously emergent property within the context of a virtual reality which is rendered and experienced by a particular information processing agent of requisite hardware and software complexity. In other words, karbytes would see itself as having the ability to literally create something, X, out of nothing, Y, by willing it (X) into existence through repetitious thought (which takes some finite amount of energy and time but which could technically happen at any point within the encompassing virtual reality&#8217;s lifespan in a manner which makes X appear to magically arise out of something X is not: Y).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ffff">At times karbytes prefers to adopt a more &#8220;hard determinist&#8221; worldview than a &#8220;compatibilist&#8221; worldview for the sake of being as minimally ideological and as <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reductionist</a> as possible.</span></p>
<p>In general, karbytes tends to exhibit exhibit a more &#8220;compatibilist&#8221; worldview than a &#8220;hard determinist&#8221; worldview for the sake of claiming to itself and other people that karbytes assumes moral and legal responsibility for karbytes&#8217; actions (and assuming such personal responsibility seems to be generally encouraged by human society given that it places humans in the role of active participants within society instead of robots which reflexively and indiscriminately carry out whatever instructions are fed into their nervous systems).</p>
