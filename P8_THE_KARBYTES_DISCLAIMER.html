<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Of all <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_primary_values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes&#8217; top-priority values</a>, truth is most paramount. Hence, it is logical for karbytes to aim for maximum historical accuracy across the time period spanning the development and karbytes-initiated preservation of karbytes (and such development and preservation efforts are implemented entirely by karbytes (though persons other than karbytes are encouraged by karbytes to routinely back up every file of karbytes to the WayBack Machine and other <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/best_practices_for_using_the_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-term and publicly-accessible data storage mediums</a> after karbytes is determined to have stopped updating karbytes (according to the ten-year minimum hiatus length policy defined in the following web page: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_possibly_stops_growing/</a>))).</p>
<p>As time elapses across the time period spanning the development and karbytes-initiated preservation of karbytes, karbytes endeavors to maximize the percentage of karbytes which karbytes thinks is professional-quality (rather than excessively informal or amateur-sounding), inspiring of positive emotions such as joy, compassion, and courage (rather than mostly provoking negative emotions such as disgust, anger, and despair), and centering on relatively timeless scientific, philosophical, or technological concepts (such as foundational topics in computer science, historically significant discoveries or theories in physics, and fundamentals of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_ontology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ontology</a>).</p>
<p>Concisely said, karbytes is a project centered on the personal evolution of karbytes (both the author/curator named karbytes and the collection of files which authored/curated that collection). The evolutionary trajectory of karbytes is a journey characterized by learning, encountering (and overcoming or at least coping with) adversity, and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">striving for immortality</a> (to the fullest extent possible). karbytes&#8217; desire (and fear) driven ambitions have imbued that collection with a distinctive qualitative flavor and is part of <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_unique_identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes&#8217; unique and non-fungible identity</a> on the World Wide Web and in the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/multiverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiverse/universe</a> at large.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
