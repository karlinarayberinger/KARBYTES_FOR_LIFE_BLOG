<p><span style="background:#ffff00">The following is a list of &#8220;best practices&#8221; (according to karbytes) for building a home on the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a>:</span></p>

<p><strong>1. Create a free <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress dot Com</a> website.</strong> I recommend using the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://wordpress.com/theme/intergalactic-2/karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intergalactic WordPress theme</a> because it is a streamlined and easy-to-read interface (with high-contrast colors and sans serif font) and because all pages which are published on your website are listed in alphabetical order in the drop-down menu which appears when website visitors click the MENU button in the upper right corner of every page of your website. You can use your website to share your stories, interests, links to favorite websites, pictures, and more.</p>
<p>(Both of my personal websites (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com</a> and <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) use the Intergalactic theme. I use my websites to store cherished memories which I want to have access to for the rest of my life and to have a platform by which to share my personal interests and knowledge with the general public (i.e. anyone with unrestricted access to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearnet_(networking)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Surface Web</a>)).</p>

<p><strong>2. Regularly save each page of your website to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a>.</strong> Doing this guarantees (with a relatively high degree of certainty) that you will have a virtually indestructible copy of each web page you save to the WayBack Machine forever. This is useful in the event that you or someone else tampers with your website or deletes it. You can look up saved web pages in the WayBack Machine and use those saved web page copies to reconstruct your deleted or damaged web pages.</p>
<p>Note that sometimes the WayBack Machine does not properly save web pages. For example, some saves are lost even after they appear to have been successfully saved. Also, sometimes the WayBack Machine fails to save the latest version of a web page (which means you will have to wait 45 minutes to re-save that particular web page). That is why <u>I recommend you save each page of your website to the WayBack Machine multiple times and routinely so that the chances of you having retrievable copies of your web page are as high as possible.</u> </p>
<p>Also note that the WayBack Machine only allows you to save the same URL (i.e. web page address) ten times per day (and, for some web resources such as raw <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MP4_file_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MP4</a> files which are part of a public GitHub repository, the daily WayBack Machine save quota is two). Finally, if you save all the web pages of your website to the WayBack Machine, when you click on a link to a page of your website inside of a WayBack Machine saved web page of your website, clicking on that link will open up the latest WayBack Machine save of the referenced web page instead of the actual web page (which means that you can simulate the experience of visiting your actual website using only the WayBack Machine, an Internet connection, a web browser, and a computational device you have access to such as a laptop computer, desktop computer, or smartphone).</p>
<p>Finally, image files (especially large image files) and most play-able videos and other multimedia widgets which are embedded in a web page tend to not get saved to the WayBack Machine even while their container web pages do get saved (but those pages get saved such the WayBack Machine captures of those web pages is missing those embedded page elements). A workaround for that which I use is as follows: <u>if you don&#8217;t already have one, create a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> account and, on that account, create at least one public (instead of private) GitHub repository in which you save images, videos, and web page source code files from your WordPress dot Com website (and, for each of those files, save the <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_code_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL for the raw GitHub-hosted version of that file</a> on the WayBack Machine). It also helps to display hyperlinks to each of those raw GitHub files on your WordPress dot Com website in order to keep all of your <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/raw_github_files_macro_directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website&#8217;s essential content tied together</a> in an orderly and easy-to-navigate fashion.</u></p>
<p>(I have made a point of saving each page of my personal websites to the WayBack Machine at least once per every three months. I plan to do that until I die (if I die)).</p>

<p><strong>3. Create and use social media accounts.</strong> Social media accounts are an excellent way to stay informed about topics which are interesting to you, to participate in public (and private) discussions with other people, and to share your ideas, images, and links to web pages with other people. I recommend Twitter and Minds (though I also use LinkedIn and Patreon (and, yes, even Instagram and Facebook (but I almost never use Facebook anymore))) as social media platforms to use regularly because you can make all of your content public even to those without user accounts on those social media platforms. I do not recommend Facebook because it is known to censor content and it seems to be more oriented towards sharing content with friends and family instead of with the world at large. I have found Instagram to be a fun source of news and an almost mandatory platform for visual artists to have (because the platform emphasizes sharing images above all else and, on your Instagram profile, a visually pleasing three-column grid displays each of your image and video posts as clickable squares of the same size in chronological order with your most recent post at the top left corner and your oldest post at the bottom right corner of that grid).</p>
<p>(To see my social media accounts, visit the home page of either one of my personal websites and scroll towards the bottom of that page to find hyperlinks leading to my Twitter profile, Minds profile, LinkedIn profile, Instagram profile, and Patreon profile).</p>
<p>The Internet is a vast (and growing) smorgasbord of informational resources which are (almost) instantaneously accessible no matter where you are located (at least on Planet Earth at the time this article was written. Someday, I imagine that there will be an interplanetary Internet spanning all of Planet Earth, any major space stations, and Planet Mars). The best way (in my opinion) to get comfortable with and have a good time using the Internet is to spend lots of time simply playing around and exploring whatever websites pique your interest such as Wikipedia (a giant volunteer made encyclopedia on many subjects), YouTube (a giant database of videos made by people ranging from ordinary people to experts), and Reddit (a giant forum containing many special interest forums for discussing various topics with other users).</p>
<p>Well, I hope this &#8220;best practices&#8221; article helps you get started with navigating the Internet. It&#8217;s never too late to get started and, as long as humanity is sufficiently large and cooperative, I think the World Wide Web will continue expanding in terms of how much data it contains and how many people use it (though I do think it is possible that the death rate will reach close to zero once medical technology becomes advanced enough to extend each person&#8217;s lifespan indefinitely (especially by replacing damaged tissues with new tissues grown from stem cells)). I wish you the best on your adventures through cyberspace.</p>
