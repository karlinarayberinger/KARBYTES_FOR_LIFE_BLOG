<p><strong>KARBYTES_CODE_CONTINUES</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>karbytes would like to announce to the general public that karbytes, starting officially &#8220;today&#8221; (i.e. the day labeled 24_DECEMBER_2023 by karbytes), will update the time stamps (which each denote the approximate time at which karbytes updated a particular section of the website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com</a>) which are displayed to the right of each numerically indexed section hyperlink on the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com if and only if the source code for any web page within the corresponding website section has been updated by karbytes (at approximately the time that section was most recently updated by karbytes).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">To be clear, what karbytes implies by the previous paragraph is that karbytes will not update any of those aforementioned time stamps if karbytes only edits the content of a plain-text file or source code file which is (a) located inside of a public karbytes-created GitHub repository and (b) is accessible as a raw file via a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperlink</a> which is displayed on at least one web page within at least one of karbytes&#8217; personal websites (especially the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com).</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00"><strong><u>A general rule I have for myself is to make as few edits to web pages (whose domain is either <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Archive dot Org</a>, <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress dot Com</a>, or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub dot Com</a>) which I classify as being part of the body of digital public domain intellectual property named karbytes</u></strong> (which I go into more detail in defining in the web page named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ABOUT_KARBYTES</a> of my personal website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) as possible and, also, to close each of those aforementioned web hosted files to any further modifications within 24 hours of publishing those files (to publicly accessible and fully <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a> save-able web pages which each have exactly one uniquely corresponding <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uniform resource locator</a> (i.e. web page address) which can be used to copy the contents of the associated web resource into a new replica web page on the WayBack Machine&#8217;s public database (at Archive dot Org)).</span></p>
<p>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, I would like to posit to the general public that, if I do not make any modifications (i.e. adding new files, removing files, or changing the contents of files) to any of the public web hosted files which I refer to as karbytes for more than ten years, then I would advise people to assume that the body of public domain web based intellectual property referred to as karbytes is closed off to further changes forever (with almost zero exceptions).</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Finally, I would like to announce that <strong><u>I disapprove of any information processing agent (other than karbytes) making any modifications to the aforementioned body of public domain web based intellectual property referred to as karbytes (except for some hypothetical exceptions).</u></strong> I have always intended for karbytes to be solely managed by its creator: Kar Beringer (i.e. karbytes).</span></p>

<p>Each of the (raw) code and (raw) media files which are inside of the public <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> repositories which are featured on this web page have been saved to the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WayBack Machine</a>.</p>
<p>(Raw GitHub user content files such as C++ source code are stripped of any HTML/CSS formatting.
