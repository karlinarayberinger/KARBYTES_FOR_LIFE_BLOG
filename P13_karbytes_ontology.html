<p><strong><u>HEDONISM:</u></strong> the propensity of some types of sufficiently complex <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agents</a> to always attempt to minimize the degree to which the respective information processing agent suffers and to maximize the degree to which that information processing agent experiences pleasure.</p>
<p>Hedonism can be thought of as the most basic heuristic which determines the priorities of sentient information processing agents (especially if <strong>&#8220;suffering&#8221;</strong> is generalized as being the subjective experience of pain (however rudimentary) and/or damage to the respective information processing agent&#8217;s hardware or essential software while <strong>&#8220;pleasure&#8221;</strong> is generalized as being the subjective experience of reward (especially related to the attainment of goals) and/or the fortification of the respective information processing agent&#8217;s hardware or essential software).</p>

<p><strong><u>COMPATIBILISM:</u></strong> the worldview that <strong>&#8220;free will&#8221;</strong> (i.e. <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agency</a>) is an emergent property of fundamentally deterministic factors and that &#8220;free will&#8221; exists only within the context of the respective information processing agent&#8217;s <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/knowledge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mental model</a> of reality (which means that, to some extent, &#8220;free will&#8221; is an illusion which obscures the deterministic and unconscious processes underlying conscious behavior).</p>
<p>The degree to which an information processing agent experiences itself as having agency depends on how that information processing agent&#8217;s constituent hardware, internal software, and external environment are configured. Basically, &#8220;free will&#8221; is a continuum value ranging from &#8220;absolutely no free will&#8221; (such as in the case of machines which lack internal representations of themselves and their encompassing environments) to &#8220;absolute freedom to do anything&#8221; (such as in the case of a hypothetical god-like being with omniscience and omnipotence).</p>
<p><strong>Determinism</strong> is the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/causality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causal</a> relationship between successive events. <strong>Indeterminism</strong> is the occurance of events which have no prior cause.</p>

<p><strong><u>MATHEMATICS:</u></strong> abstract <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">logical</a> relationships between <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">numbers</a> which are immutably and ubiquitously true. Mathematics describes physical reality in precise ways (especially in the form of (contestable yet well-established) <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener">physical laws</a> which describe patterns in observed <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence" target="_blank" rel="noopener">empirical</a> data) while also simultaneously existing in the realm of pure potential independently of physical <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a>.</p>
