<p><strong>ABSOLUTE_PERMISSIVENESS</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p><span style="background:#ffff00;">From this moment forward, I hereby grant myself (and every other person) permission to do anything and to not have to adhere to any particular rules of conduct nor to any particular expectations about how phenomena are &#8220;supposed to&#8221; manifest.</span> To elaborate on what I just said, I grant every person permission to either intentionally lie or else to not intentionally lie; to attempt to describe reality as truthfully, comprehensively, and succinctly as possible or else to not describe reality as truthfully, comprehensively, and succinctly as possible;  to conform to one&#8217;s own plans or else to not conform to one&#8217;s own plans; and to change one&#8217;s mind indefinitely many times for any reason.</p>
<p>In my personal experience, it generally seems easier for me to accomplish my goals if I do not demand that my goals be accomplished in a very limited way (or even at all). Perhaps that is because, generally, the less I try to control myself (and other persons, my environment, et cetera), the less I feel my ego has to lose (and hence fret about) since, rather than demand that specific conditions be present in order for me to feel that my experience of the present is not a waste of my time, the path of least resistance seems to be accepting reality exactly as it is whether reality is currently (from my vantage) conforming to my current preferences and/or expectations or else not conforming to my current preferences and/or expectations.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
