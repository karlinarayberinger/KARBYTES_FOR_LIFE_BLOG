<p>DISCLAIMER: CONTEXT FOR PAST WRITINGS</p>
<p>I, karbytes, maintain this website as a platform for intellectual exploration, personal expression, and philosophical inquiry. Over the years, I have written about a wide range of topics—including some that may appear controversial, intense, or emotionally charged.</p>
<p>I want to clarify the following points regarding my past writings:</p>
<p>1️⃣ Personal Evolution &amp; Changing Perspectives</p>
<p>The views expressed in past posts were written at specific moments in my life and do not necessarily reflect my current beliefs.</p>
<p>I, like anyone else, continue to learn, adapt, and refine my understanding of the world.</p>
<p>2️⃣ Use of Emotionally Intense or Hypothetical Language</p>
<p>Some writings contain exaggerated, speculative, or metaphorical elements meant for exploration rather than literal endorsement.</p>
<p>Any mentions of violence, revenge, or extreme ideologies were often artistic, theoretical, or driven by frustration—not incitements to action.</p>
<p>3️⃣ No Endorsement of Harm or Hate</p>
<p>I do not advocate for violence, hate, or harm against any individual or group.</p>
<p>If any past posts appear to suggest otherwise, they should be interpreted as rhetorical exercises, artistic expressions, or thought experiments — not literal calls to action.</p>
<p>4️⃣ Commitment to Intellectual Freedom</p>
<p>I believe in the right to explore challenging ideas, express emotions freely, and critique society without fear of misinterpretation.</p>
<p>However, I also acknowledge that words have impact, and I encourage nuanced, thoughtful engagement with the ideas on this site.</p>
<p>Final Note</p>
<p>This website remains a personal space for my evolving thoughts. If you have concerns about past writings, I encourage contextual reading and open-minded discussion rather than assumption or hostility.</p>
